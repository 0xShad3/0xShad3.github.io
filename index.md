Welcome to my blog I'm Angelos (0xShad3), a computer security researcher, 
I specialise in low level stuff, reverse engineering, vulnerability research,
exploit development etc. I love finding bugs and (ab)-using them to turn software into 
performing things that is not intended to perform :).
Other than doing hacky things I am an avid book reader, semi-pro wine taster and fairly average home cook.
